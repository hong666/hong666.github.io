  "body": "***\r\n# **Project  Introduction**\r\n3D reconstruction from multiple images is the creation of three-dimensional \r\nmodels from a set of images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images \r\nfrom 3D scenes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe essence of an image is a projection from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, \r\nduring which process the depth is lost. The 3D point corresponding to a \r\nspecific image point is constrained to be on the line of sight. From a single \r\nimage, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to \r\nthe image point. If two images are available, then the position of a 3D point \r\ncan be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. This process is \r\nreferred to as triangulation. The key for this process is the relations between \r\nmultiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of \r\npoints must contain some structure and that this structure is related to the \r\nposes and the calibration of the camera. <br>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# **Group Members**\r\n* 刘子健　　M201572360\r\n* 李婷婷　　M201572361\r\n* 潘治鸿　　M201572364\r\n* 欧阳超　　M201572328\r\n\r\n***\r\n# **Project Progress**\r\n## 2016.5.20　第一周\r\n1. 项目选题和网页制作；\r\n2. 阅读三维重建相关资料，了解三维重建的基本原理、流程和方法；\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
