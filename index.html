<p>3D reconstruction from multiple images is the creation of three-dimensional 
models from a set of images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images 
from 3D scenes. <br>
<br>
The essence of an image is a projection from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, 
during which process the depth is lost. The 3D point corresponding to a 
specific image point is constrained to be on the line of sight. From a single 
image, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to 
the image point. If two images are available, then the position of a 3D point 
can be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. This process is 
referred to as triangulation. The key for this process is the relations between 
multiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of 
points must contain some structure and that this structure is related to the 
poses and the calibration of the camera. <br></p>
